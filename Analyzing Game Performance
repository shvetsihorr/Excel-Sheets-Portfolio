### Analyzing Game Performance and Monetization Metrics

- **Skills demonstrated**: Data cleaning, advanced formula usage, user behavior analysis, and data-driven insights.
- **Key functions used**: `SUMIF()`, `COUNTIF()`, `AVERAGEIF()`, `MEDIAN()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`, and `ARRAYFORMULA()` for efficient data calculations.

- **Tasks**:
  - **Data Cleaning**: Ensured data consistency and accuracy across all game metrics.
  - **Data Calculations**:
    1. **Total Revenue**: Calculated the total revenue for each game using the sum of the revenue column.
    2. **Paid Users Count**: Counted the total number of paying users.
    3. **CR to Paid**: Calculated conversion rate (CR) from users to paying users as a percentage.
    4. **ARPPU**: Determined the average revenue per paying user.
    5. **Average Age (Paid Users)**: Calculated the average age of paying users across all games.
    6. **Median Age (Paid Users)**: Calculated the median age of paying users.
    7. **Minimum Age (Paid Users)**: Found the minimum age among paying users.
    8. **Maximum Age (Paid Users)**: Found the maximum age among paying users.
  
- **Recommendations**:
  - Identify age segments with higher conversion rates to focus marketing efforts.
  - Optimize user acquisition strategies by targeting demographics with higher monetization potential.
  - Enhance in-game monetization features tailored for paying users' behaviors.
