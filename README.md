## Introduction

This portfolio includes multiple data analysis projects completed using **Microsoft Excel** and **Google Sheets**. My focus is on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data to extract valuable insights. Iâ€™ve applied industry-standard techniques to solve problems and communicate findings effectively.

## Projects

### Project 1: Analyzing Game Performance and Monetization Metrics!

[View Project](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F9Uwg5q6XEsSFQx10aBxMZngsFyvJbU7XD-G8UP7-DA/edit?usp=sharing)

**Summary**: Analyzed key game metrics using Google Sheets to evaluate user acquisition and monetization. I was focused on data cleaning and calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) to drive insights for improving game performance.

### Project 2: User Demographics and Device Analysis

[View Project](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LHg_NAnDhJs7B9ctFCGpdEKKXfptMYYg-y1Fdkvz8l8/edit?usp=sharing)

**Summary**: I analyzed user age demographics and device usage for active users and conducted statistical analysis on age distribution and created visualizations to understand user language preferences and device models.

- **Skills demonstrated**: Descriptive statistics, data visualization, data analysis.
- **Key functions used**: `AVERAGE()`, `STDEV()`, `MEDIAN()`, `QUARTILE()`, percentiles, horizontal bar charts, pie charts and Interquartile Range (IQR)
- **Outcome**: Provided insights into user age distribution, language preferences, and device model trends.

### Project 3: Daily and Weekly Active Users Analysis

[View Project](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XgtfhbdW503GjHmgtdPYeKhkjHSXRfmUKU4CgEMyUUA/edit?usp=sharing)

**Summary**: I analyzed user engagement by creating and managing sheets for Daily Active Users (DAU) and Weekly Active Users (WAU), including statistical calculations and data visualizations.

- **Skills demonstrated**: Data manipulation, statistical analysis, data visualization, trend analysis, and use of advanced spreadsheet functions.

- **Enhanced Activity Sheet**: Added columns for `week_start_date`, `weekday`, `activity_month`, `activity_month_number`, and `1st_activity_month`.
- **DAU Sheet**: Created a sheet with unique `activity_date` values, calculated DAU using `COUNTUNIQUEIFS`, and added `week_start_date`.
- **WAU Sheet**: Developed a sheet with unique `week_start_date` values, calculated WAU, and included columns for Average DAU, DAU/WAU ratio, and Stickiness (DAU/WAU).
- **WAU Trend Analysis**: Created a chart on the "WAU" sheet with weeks on the horizontal axis and WAU values on the vertical axis. Added a linear trendline to visualize trends in weekly active users over time.

This project provides a comprehensive view of user engagement, including trend analysis to support strategic decision-making.
